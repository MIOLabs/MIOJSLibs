Cocoa / Cocoa touch on the web

These libraries are designing to develop a web or web application in the same way like if you develop a native iOS/macOS application.

Brief history:

With the new HTML5 and CSS tools you have the option to develop a web app or a native app, but usually the majority companies go web first (and last sometimes), because easy to develop an app in the web (even with differents browsers) than develop an app for differents OS like Windows, or macOS.

What is not inttend for:

- It's not a UI framework that looks like iOS / macOS native application.
- It's not a frame that converts the swift or objetive-c code in a web application
- The classes, functions, etc.. are similar to Cocoa / Cocoa touch but with sligth differences to work in the web. So it is not inttented to be a exact match, but most of the time are quite similar.
- It's not desgin to create a simple web page, also you can do it but it was nos desing to.
