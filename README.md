These libraries are designed to let you develop a web application the same way you would develop a native iOS/macOS application.

## **Brief history:**

Have you ever wished to share code between platforms? Do you like the Apple frameworks but you want/need to develop in other platforms? Code sharing and Apple frameworks on different platforms; we are making that possible.

MioLabs is porting the Apple frameworks like Foundation, UIKit and CoreData to other platforms such as the web, backend servers and hardware microcontrollers!

We choose Swift as our main language programming and now you can share both the programming logic and language and use the same API you already know and love! We have ported the libraries and created a compiler/transpiler, all based around Apple frameworks and Swift language, for the other platforms/environments.

This is currently under heavy development, but we have come a long way from where we were two years ago when we started to port these frameworks to the web. Now we are taking another step forward implementing Swift code into all platforms making code sharing possible and making you into a faster, more efficient developer.

The MIOLabs team!

**I started this project to solve these things:**

* The design team needs to see how looks like the view or app with standard HTML5/CSS tools.
* We don’t want another runtime.
* The code, should be simple, but powerful enough to develop huge web application so we can maintain with few resources
* All common patterns in native app should be built into the frameworks
* All teams, can switch between web app and iOS app with ease, because the API works almost the same
* Animation in mind! All mobile and desktop native apps has beautiful transitions/animations. The majority of webs don't have transitions at all. (A transtion/animation informs the user where he was and how to go back, safe you a UI elements specially in mobile apps)

**What is not intend for:**

* It's not a UI framework that looks like iOS / macOS native application.
* It's not a framework that converts the swift or Objective-C code into a web application.
* The classes, functions, etc. are like Cocoa / Cocoa touch but with slight differences to work on the web. It’s not intended to be an exact match, but most of the time are quite similar.
* It's not design to create a simple web page (Of course, you can do it).
